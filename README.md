## LibDriver AT24CXX

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/at24cxx/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

AT24CXX is the EEPROM of IIC bus launched by Microchip. It supports 1.7v-5.5v power supply range, IIC standard mode (100kHz), fast mode (400kHz) and high speed mode (1MHz).

LibDriver AT24CXX is a full-featured driver for AT24CXX, launched by LibDriver. It provides EEPROM writing, EEPROM reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver AT24CXX source files.

/interface includes LibDriver AT24CXX IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver AT24CXX driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver AT24CXX sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver AT24CXX offline document.

/datasheet includes AT24CXX datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_at24cxx_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t data;

res = at24cxx_basic_init(AT24C01, AT24CXX_ADDRESS_A000);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

res = at24cxx_basic_read(0x00, (uint8_t *)&data, 1);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)at24cxx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}
else
{
    at24cxx_interface_debug_print("at24cxx: 0x%02X.\n", data);
}

...

res = at24cxx_basic_write(0x00, (uint8_t *)&data, 1);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)at24cxx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}
else
{
    at24cxx_interface_debug_print("at24cxx: 0x%02X.\n", data);
}

...

(void)at24cxx_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
